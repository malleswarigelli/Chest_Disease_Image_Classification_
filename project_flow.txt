Project name: Chest disease classification from CT Scan Image 

- Image classification with Tensorflow
- Build neural network (ANN, CNN)

flow
1. project introduction
2. create project template
3. project setup
4. requirements.txt installation
5. create, activate virtual environment
6. logging, exception, utility
7. project workflow ...
8. All components notebook Experiment --> data ingestion (read image data from google drive), CNN extracts features directly (validation, transformation not needed),
                                          prepare base model (pretrained ensemble model: vgg16), 
                                          model training, model evaluation (metrics: accuracy, losses), model pusher
9. All components modular coding implementation
10. pipelines: training, prediction
11. MLOPs tools: mlflow (experiment tracking), model registration
                 DVC: Data version control (for pipeline tracking), since DL project with images, training is computationally expensive, pipeline tracking helps 
12. User app i.e App.py
13. Docker 
14. CI/CD deployment using Jenkins
