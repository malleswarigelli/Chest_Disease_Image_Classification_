Project name: Chest disease classification from CT Scan Image 

- Image classification with Tensorflow
- Build neural network (ANN, CNN)

flow
1. project introduction
2. create project template
3. project setup (create, activate virtual environment, requirements.txt installation)
4. logging, exception, utility
5. project workflow ...
6. All components notebook Experiment --> data ingestion (read image data from google drive), CNN extracts features directly (validation, transformation not needed),
                                          prepare base model (pretrained ensemble model: vgg16), 
                                          model training, model evaluation (metrics: accuracy, losses), model pusher
7. All components modular coding implementation
8. pipelines: training, prediction
9. MLOPs tools: mlflow (experiment tracking), model registration
                 DVC: Data version control (for pipeline tracking), since DL project with images, training is computationally expensive, pipeline tracking helps 
10. User app i.e App.py (Flask, web application framework)
11. Docker 
12. CI/CD deployment using Jenkins
